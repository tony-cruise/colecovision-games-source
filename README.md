# Colecovision Games Source

A collection of the source code of games for the ColecoVision console and Adam home computer.

## Introduction

Each game has its own directory in the repository that will contain the original source code (mostly disassembled from the final game ROMs), development notes, history and any adjusted/hacked versions that make specific changes or fix bugs in the original titles.
